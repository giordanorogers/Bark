# To add a new feature to Bark:

## Data Persistence

## Business Logic
Add in the commands module

## User Interaction
Add in the bark module

### TIP:
Duplicating some code and updating that new copy to do what you need is a perfectly valid
approach to extension.
By creating a duplicate version, altering it, and seeing how the two versions differ,
we can more easily refactor that duplicated code back into a single, multipurpose
version later.
